# 🎬 Movie Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing a dataset of movies to extract useful insights using Python and data analysis libraries. It was done as part of my data analytics learning journey.

## 📊 Project Overview
The analysis highlights:
- 🎥 Top Performing Movies based on ratings and revenue
- 🎭 Popular Genres across different time periods
- 🗓️ Movie Release Trends over the years
- 💰 Revenue vs Budget Correlation
- ⭐ High-rated Movies vs Commercial Success

## 📁 Project Structure

- Movie_Data.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- README.md: Project documentation.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analysis of movie genres, ratings, and revenues
- Visualization of trends (e.g., number of movies over the years, top-rated genres)
- Correlation analysis between different movie features

## 💡 Insights Gained

- Identified the most popular and profitable genres
- Discovered trends in movie production and release years
- Found correlations between budget, revenue, and ratings
